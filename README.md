 
Auca Connection (Adventist University of Central Africa) is a kind of social Network that i create to help student to
be update of what happened to school even if they are not there. The first reason i create the platform was to encourage 
student to take part of the announcement gave by the staff of the University.
A list below of what the platform has in it:

	1)You register first,you give your first name,last name,id number,faculty and your semester
	2)Then you login
	3)If your login is successful ,on the first page you can see: The verse of the day(An administration page
		has been created to update the verse day after day)
	4)You can also see the anoouncement below of "The verse of the day" .on the same administration page we can update an announcement(Who write the announcement,to whow they are destined, and the announcement itself)
